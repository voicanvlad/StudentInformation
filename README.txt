A program that lets you manage a list of students using a Graphical Interface. It automatically imports a .txt file that contains
information about students ( first name, last name, attendance ). You can add more students to the list, remove some of them or sort
them based on their attendance, directly from the interface. The final list can be saved in a .txt file using the interface menu bar and it
will be imported along with the next execution of the program.
